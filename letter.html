      There are so many things I wish I could say out loud,
      but words always feel heavier when written like this.
      Still, I want you to know this —
      you are the calm in my chaos,
      the light in my darkest nights.
      <br><br>
      Loving you has changed me in ways I never expected.
      Even from miles away, your presence feels close.
      I carry you with me in every dream,
      every prayer,
      every quiet moment.
      <br><br>
      If I could give you one thing in this life,
      it would be the ability to see yourself
      the way I see you.
